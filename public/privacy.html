    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>WayMark helps users interact with data stored in Google Sheets and Google Drive. This policy explains what information is processed and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Process</h2>

      <li>OAuth tokens required to access approved Google APIs</li>
      <li>Google Drive and Google Sheets metadata/content needed for app features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Google API Data Use</h2>
