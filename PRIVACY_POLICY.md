# WayMark Privacy Policy

Last updated: February 28, 2026

## 1. Overview

WayMark helps users interact with data stored in their Google Sheets and Google Drive. This Privacy Policy explains what information WayMark processes, how it is used, and your choices.

## 2. Information We Process

WayMark may process:

- Google account basic profile information (name, email, profile image)
- Google OAuth tokens required to access approved Google APIs
- Google Drive and Google Sheets metadata/content needed to render app features
- User interactions in the app (for normal application functionality)

WayMark does not sell personal information.

## 3. Google API Data Use

WayMark uses Google APIs only to provide core application features requested by the user, including:

- Browsing Drive folders/files
- Reading and updating spreadsheet data
- AI-assisted retrieval features based on user-selected content

WayMark’s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.

## 4. Authentication and Session Handling

- OAuth uses Google’s authorization flow.
- A short-lived access token is held in memory on the client.
- A refresh token may be stored in a secure, HTTP-only cookie managed by the server.
- Session cookies are used only for authentication/session continuity.

## 5. Data Storage and Retention

- WayMark is designed to keep canonical user data in Google Sheets/Drive.
- The app may temporarily process API responses in memory.
- Local development and test modes may use local fixture/mock data.
- Production retention depends on deployment settings and logs.

## 6. Data Sharing

WayMark does not share your data with third parties except:

- Google services you explicitly authorize through OAuth
- Service providers required to host or operate the app
- Legal obligations or lawful requests

## 7. Security

WayMark uses reasonable safeguards, including HTTPS (in production), secure cookie practices, and least-privilege API scope usage where possible. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 8. Your Choices and Rights

You can:

- Revoke app access in your Google Account permissions settings
- Request deletion of application-controlled data where applicable
- Stop using the app at any time

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have additional privacy rights.

## 9. Children’s Privacy

WayMark is not intended for children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction).

## 10. Changes to This Policy

This policy may be updated from time to time. The "Last updated" date will reflect changes.
